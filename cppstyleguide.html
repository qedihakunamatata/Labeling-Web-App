<h1>Google C++ Style Guide</h1>

<p>C++ is one of the main development languages  used by
many of Google's open-source projects. As every C++
programmer knows, the language has many powerful features, but
this power brings with it's complexity, which in turn can make
code more bug-prone and harder to read and maintain.
</p>
  
<p>The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by
describing in detail the dos and don'ts of writing C++ code
. These rules exist to
keep  the code base manageable while still allowing
coders to use C++ language features productively.
